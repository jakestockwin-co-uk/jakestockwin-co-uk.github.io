<p>
  My research involves building and analysing mathematical models to inform strategies for controlling infectious diseases.
  I develop mathematical modeling theory, and apply it along with statistical parameter estimation techniques, to address
  previously unanswered biological questions. Recently, I have been investigating whether or not it is possible to make
  predictions about how an infectious disease outbreak will advance soon after the first infected individuals exhibit symptoms.
  I use Ebola as a case study, since initial cases do not always lead to a major outbreak. However, the conclusions from most
  of my work are applicable to a range of diseases in humans, animals and plants.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>The main focus of my work is building and analysing mathematical models to inform strategies for controlling various infectious
diseases (in humans and animals, as well as plants), with Dr Nik Cunniffe and Prof Chris Gilligan in Cambridge.  We use stochastic
 and deterministic modelling approaches, and parameterise the models via methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Approximate
 Bayesian Computation.  Current projects include:</p>

<p><b>1.  Predicting how widespread pathogens will become using spread data from early in epidemics</b></p>

<p>An ability to predict how widespread a pathogen is likely to become using data from early in an epidemic is important for planning
control strategies.  We are developing a framework where, using stochastic models, the maximum number of simultaneously infected
individuals over the course of the epidemic can be predicted using data from the first few days of the epidemic.<p>

<p><b>2.  Biological control: Investigating the phenomenon of take-all decline</b></p>

<p>Commonly-used techniques for controlling crop diseases, including fungicides and crop rotation, have ecological, economic and
environmental disadvantages. Experimentalists have therefore become more interested in biological control, where an antagonist
(a natural enemy of the pathogen) is deployed to reduce disease. A naturally-occurring phenomenon that indicates the potential
of biological control is control by Pseudomonas fluorescens of the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, which causes
devastating epidemics in the first years of wheat monoculture, followed by smaller epidemics in subsequent years. However, whilst
experimentation has elucidated the physiological basis of a number of host-pathogen-antagonist interactions, mathematical models
are less well developed and the performance of biological control is beset by variability.  We address this, using mathematical
models to determine how the efficacy of biological control could be improved, and how biological control should be deployed effectively.</p>

<p>I would like to thank BBSRC for the funding (via the Genes to Organisms PhD Programme in integrative biology) that makes the above
research projects possible.</p>
