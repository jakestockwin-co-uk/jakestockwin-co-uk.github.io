<p>
  My research involves building and analysing mathematical models to inform strategies for controlling infectious diseases.
  I develop mathematical modeling theory, and apply it along with statistical parameter estimation techniques, to address
  previously unanswered biological questions. Recently, I have been investigating whether or not it is possible to make
  predictions about how an infectious disease outbreak will advance soon after the first infected individuals exhibit symptoms.
  I use Ebola as a case study, since initial cases do not always lead to a major outbreak. However, the conclusions from most
  of my work are applicable to a range of diseases in humans, animals and plants.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>The main focus of my work is building and analysing mathematical models to inform strategies for controlling various infectious
diseases (in humans and animals, as well as plants), with Dr Nik Cunniffe and Prof Chris Gilligan in Cambridge.  We use stochastic
 and deterministic modelling approaches, and parameterise the models via methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Approximate
 Bayesian Computation.</p>
