  My research involves building and analysing mathematical models to inform strategies for controlling infectious diseases in humans, animals and plants. This involves using
stochastic and deterministic modelling approaches, and parameterising the models using statistical parameter inference techniques. I am also interested in pathogen evolution, and I hold a postdoctoral research assistant position supervised by Dr Katrina Lythgoe in Oxford. This focuses on building and analysing mathematical and computational models
to investigate the impact of pathogen evolution on the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks.
