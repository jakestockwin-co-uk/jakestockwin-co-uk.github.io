title: Predicting how widespread pathogens will become using spread data from early in epidemics
---
<p>An ability to predict how widespread a pathogen is likely to become using data from early in an epidemic is important for planning
control strategies.  We are developing a framework where, using stochastic models, the maximum number of simultaneously infected
individuals over the course of the epidemic can be predicted using data from the first few days of the epidemic.<p>
