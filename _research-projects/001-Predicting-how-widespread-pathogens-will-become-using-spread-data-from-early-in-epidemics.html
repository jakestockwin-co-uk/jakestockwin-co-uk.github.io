title: Predicting how widespread pathogens will become using spread data from early in epidemics
---
<p>The ability to predict how widespread a pathogen is likely to become using data from early in an epidemic is important for planning
control strategies.  We are developing a framework in which, using stochastic models, the maximum number of simultaneously infected
individuals over the course of the epidemic can be predicted using data from the first few days of the epidemic. This will allow policymakers to predict whether an invading disease
is likely to overwhelm available control resources (e.g. number of available hospital beds), and if so, for the amount of additional resources required to be estimated.
