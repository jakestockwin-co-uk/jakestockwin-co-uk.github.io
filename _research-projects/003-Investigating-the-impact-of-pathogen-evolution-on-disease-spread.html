title: "Investigating the impact of within-host pathogen evolution on disease spread and control at the population scale"
---

<p>
Mathematical models are frequently used to forecast the likely progression of infectious disease outbreaks and to plan control strategies.
However, for a number of diseases, pathogen evolution is a barrier to efficient disease control. This makes the incorporation of realistic evolutionary processes 
in epidemiological models an important goal for accurate predictions to ever be made. Pathogen evolution is of particular significance for chronic viruses such as HIV because rapid within-host evolution, 
combined with long durations of infection, means transmitted strains will often be different from the founder strains that initiate infections. This project involves integrating 
models of within-host evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics into population-scale models. The resulting models will not only be used to investigate the impact of pathogen evolution
on disease spread, but also to address important applied questions about population-scale evolutionary behaviour.
