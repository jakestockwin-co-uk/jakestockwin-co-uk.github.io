title: "Biological control: Investigating the phenomenon of take-all decline"
---

<p>Commonly-used techniques for controlling crop diseases, including fungicides and crop rotation, have ecological, economic and
environmental disadvantages. Experimentalists have therefore become more interested in biological control, where an antagonist
(a natural enemy of the pathogen) is deployed to reduce disease. A naturally-occurring phenomenon that indicates the potential
of biological control is control by Pseudomonas fluorescens of the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, which causes
devastating epidemics in the first years of wheat monoculture, followed by smaller epidemics in subsequent years. However, whilst
experimentation has elucidated the physiological basis of a number of host-pathogen-antagonist interactions, mathematical models
are less well developed and the performance of biological control is beset by variability.  We address this, using mathematical
models to determine how the efficacy of biological control could be improved, and how biological control should be deployed effectively.</p>
