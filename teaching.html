<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>
<p>I hold a stipendiary lectureship in applied mathematics at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford.  The courses that I am currently tutoring there are:</p>
<ul id="courses">


  <li>Prelims (first year)</li>

<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/26259">Geometry</a></li>
  </ul>

  <li>Part A (second year)</li>
  <ul>

<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/28679">Differential equations I</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/28698">Differential equations II</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/28778">Integral transforms</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/28704">Fluid dynamics and waves</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/28705">Numerical analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/29084">Mathematical biology</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/course/28827">Calculus of variations</a></li>
  </ul>

</ul>

<p>I have also tutored a number of other applied mathematics courses on the Oxford undergraduate syllabus, and co-supervised undergraduate dissertations and summer projects.</p>

<p>Every year, I deliver mathematical epidemiology lectures on the Wellcome Trust Mathematical Models for Infectious Disease Dynamics course in Cambridge.</p>

<p>In the past I have supervised part IA Mathematical Biology in Cambridge, as well as lecturing and running
the associated practical component for part of the course (Matrix Modelling and Applications, Easter term).
I have also held a non-stipendiary applied mathematics lectureship at Worcester College,
Oxford (also where I studied when I was an undergraduate!) </p>
