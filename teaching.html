<p>I hold a stipendiary lectureship in applied mathematics at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford.  The courses that I am currently tutoring there are

<p><b>Prelims (first year) </b>

<p>Geometry

<p><b> Part A (second year) </b>

<p>Differential equations I
<br>Differential equations II
<br>Integral transforms
<br>Fluid dynamics and waves
<br>Numerical analysis
<br>Mathematical biology
<br>Calculus of variations

<p>I have also tutored a number of other applied mathematics courses on the Oxford undergraduate syllabus, and co-supervised undergraduate dissertations and summer projects.

<p>Every year, I deliver mathematical epidemiology lectures on the Wellcome trust Mathematical Models for Infectious Disease Dynamics course in Cambridge..

<p>In the past I have supervised part IA Mathematical Biology in Cambridge, as well as lecturing and running
the associated practical component for part of the course (Matrix Modelling and Applications, Easter term).
I have also held a non-stipendiary applied mathematics lectureship at Worcester College,
Oxford (where I studied as an undergraduate).</p>
